## What is Immich?

Immich is a self-hosted backup solution for photos and videos, directly from your mobile phone
or computer, with features that are similar to Google Photos backup. In this tutorial, we will take
a look at the main features of Immich and how you can run the application using PikaPods, a
platform hosting a large selection of open source apps from $1 per month.

### Part 1: Getting Started with Immich

So, you’ve decided to opt for a Google Photos alternative that is self-hosted, and you’ve found
Immich! The next steps that you need to take to get started are super simple. The fastest way to
run the app is through PikaPods, which will allow you to run your own pod with minimal cost and
set-up involved. Here’s how:

1. Visit [pikapods.com/apps](https://pikapods.com/apps).
2. Search and run 'Immich'.
3. Create a user account once the pod is up.

### Part 2: Uploading Photos on Immich

Once you have set up your Immich account, you can upload your photos by selecting **Upload Photos** at the top right of your screen. You can then choose which photos you would like to upload, and select **open**. The selected photos will now appear in your Immich library.

### Part 3: Browsing Photos and Videos on Immich

Browsing through your photos on Immich is simple. You can navigate this through the side-bar
menu using different viewing options, including:

- Photos: This view will display your photos in chronological order, allowing you to scroll
  through a timeline and view all the photos taken within a given time period.
- Explore: This view will show you photos organised by face (in the **people** section), or
  location (in the **places** section). Users can also assign names to different faces, and
  view collections of photos that that person features in.
- Map: This option will give you a bird’s eye view of where in the world your photos were
  taken. You can zoom in on a continent, country, or specific place for a deeper look at
  your photos in different locations.

When clicking on a photo, there are several options you can choose from. You can zoom in on
the image, copy the image, download, view information, add it as a favourite, or delete it.
By clicking on the three dots, you will be able to view more options such as adding the photo to
an album or archiving it.

### Part 4: Further Browsing Options - Your Library

Apart from being able to browse through your photos using the viewing options mentioned in
Part 3 of this tutorial, you can also segment your images into different albums. This will make it
easier to share selected photos with family and friends later on. Within your library, you’ll find
the following sections:

- Favourites: Your favourites library will show you all the photos that you’ve selected as
  favourites, in one place. To mark a photo or video as a favourite, click on the heart icon
  at the top right of the visual.
- Albums: Your albums will display photos that you’ve grouped together in an album.
  These can be created by choosing to group together images that are already uploaded,
  or by uploading new photos directly from your device.

### Part 5: How to Create and Share an Album on Immich

Once you’ve uploaded your photos and created a secure, alternative to Google Photos back up
for your images and videos, it’s time to organise your photos into albums. In this way, you’ll be
able to share your memories with your friends and family by simply sending them a link to your
album! Here’s how you can create albums on Immich:

1. Go to the albums section of your library.
2. Click **Create Album** at the top right corner of your screen.
3. Choose a title for your album and add a description (optional).
4. Click on **Select Photos** to choose images from your library or upload new ones.
5. To share an album with others, click on the album and then click on the share icon at the
   top of your page.
6. Click on **Create Link** to generate a link that you can share with anyone.
7. For additional security, you can add a password that others can use to access the link.
8. Copy and paste the link to share!
