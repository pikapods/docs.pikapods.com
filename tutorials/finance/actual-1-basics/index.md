**Actual** allows you to set up multiple accounts, both on-budget and off-budget. Here's a breakdown of these account types:

- **Off-budget accounts:** These accounts don't affect your budget and are suitable for tracking investments and mortgages. Transactions within these accounts can't be categorized and solely monitor balances over time.

- **On-budget accounts:** Transactions within these accounts affect your budget and can be categorized. They are ideal for tracking cash flow and utilizing the budget, such as checking accounts and credit cards.

To create a local account:

1. Click on **all accounts** in the left sidebar.
2. Choose **+ sign** or click on **add account** on the main dashboard.
3. Select **create local account**.
4. Optionally, toggle **off-budget**.
5. Provide a **name** for the account.
6. Set a **budget amount**.
