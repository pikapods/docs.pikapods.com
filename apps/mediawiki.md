## Adjust Settings

Some settings can only be changed in a file called `LocalSettings.php`. You can edit this file for your pod using [SFTP](/faq/#accessing-pod-files-using-sftp). This file is already populated with some common settings, like database settings. You shouldn't change those, but you can change most other settings. See [here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:LocalSettings.php#Standard_settings) for a full reference.
