## Sending email
To change a user's email, you need to add email SMTP sending settings (Mailgun won't work) first. That's under *Administration > Email*. After that Flarum will be able to send its verification emails and you can change username or password of the initial admin account.

## Changing initial admin user
You MUST add SMTP settings before editing the initial admin user.

## Installing Extensions
Please contact support at `hello@pikapods.com` and we will install the extensions you need for you. They will be kept in a mounted `plugins` folder and will persist container edits and updates.
