## Updates
You may see a notification to update in Nextcloud's admin section. Since updates are centrally managed, this feature is disabled. Your pod will automatically receive updates within 1-2 weeks of their release. We also run any required migration scripts for you. ðŸ˜‡


## Warnings regarding `.well-known` paths
You may see warning regarding `.well-known` paths to CalDAV and CardDAV services in the *Security & setup warnings* section. Those are false positives and those paths will work as expected.


## Adjust PHP Settings
The default maximum upload size is set to 512 MB. You can increase this or adjust other PHP settings by editing the `uploads.ini` file using [SFTP](/faq/#accessing-pod-files-using-sftp). If you increase this value, you may also need to increase the pod's memory allocation. Settings in this file are applied after restarting the pod or changing its resources. See [here](https://www.php.net/manual/en/ini.core.php) for a detailed description of available settings.


## Scan for added files
If you uploaded files over SFTP, Nextcloud may not show them right away. You can add the below setting to ask it to look for new files on the file system. More on this [here](https://help.nextcloud.com/t/how-to-make-nextcloud-aware-of-added-files/10824/4) and [here](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/26/admin_manual/configuration_server/config_sample_php_parameters.html).

`'filesystem_check_changes' => 1,`

## Maintenance Mode
You can enable or disable maintenance mode in the configs, accessible over [SFTP](/manage/files). Find the file `config/config.php` and look for a line containing `'maintenance' => false,`. Then change to `true` or `false` as needed.

In rare cases an installation can stay in maintenance mode after an update.
