## Cache Not Clearing After Changes

When making changes in FreeScout, such as updating profile photo sizes, the changes may not take effect immediately due to caching. It's important to clear the cache to see the changes.

### Solution

To clear the FreeScout cache, follow these steps:

1. **Go to Manage > System > Tools.**
2. Click on **Clear Cache**.

This will ensure that any changes you make, such as modifying profile photo sizes, are properly applied.
