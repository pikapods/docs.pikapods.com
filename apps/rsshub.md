## Adding additional Configuration
Only the most important configuration settings are exposed as environment variables. To add additional configuration, connect via [SFTP](/faq/#accessing-pod-files-using-sftp) and edit the `.env` file already in the folder. Some SFTP client may not show hidden files (dotfiles) by default.

See [here](https://docs.rsshub.app/en/install/#configuration) for available configuration.

You have to *Restart* the pod to apply configuration changes.
