## Introduction

_PikaPods_ helps you run the best open source apps with just a few clicks. Compared to commercial online services, open source apps are developed by a community of users for users. This gives you more control and privacy over your data. And you only pay for the resource you use, not specific features. For more on the benefits of open source, see our [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gy5AbLU5LPw) on the topic.
