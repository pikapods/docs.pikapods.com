# Pod Management

It's easy to get started with our pods, but advanced features are there if you need them:

## [Getting Started](getting-started)

New to PikaPods? Learn how to create an account, deploy your first app, and start using it in minutes. No credit card required and you get $5 in free credits to explore.

## [Custom Domain](custom-domains)

Attach your own domain to a pod. Make your app accessible under your own brand, like blog.yourdomain.com. We automatically handle SSL certificates to keep your connection secure.

## [Files](files)

Access pod files using SFTP. Upload, download, and manage your pod's files directly from your computer. This gives you full control over your data and makes migrations easy.

## [Database](database)

Manage the pod's database. View, edit, and export your app's data when needed. Useful for advanced customizations, migrations, or manual data corrections.

## [Backup](backup)

Learn how to perform backups of pod data. Keep your data safe with automatic daily backups to your own storage. Backups are encrypted and incremental, so only changes are transferred.

## [Debug](debug)

Troubleshoot and debug your pod. Find and fix issues quickly by viewing application logs. Learn how to diagnose startup problems and get your pod running again.
