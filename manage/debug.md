# Debugging a Pod

If a pod shows "Pod is loading..." for more than a few minutes, there is usually an issue with starting it. This could be an issue with settings or permissions. In most cases the detailed error can be found in the pod logs. To view them, just click the _Show Logs_ button and look for obvious errors. If the error is unclear or log is empty, you can also use _Report Issue_, include the logs you got and we'll investigate further.
